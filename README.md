# Nordix installer


I wrote an installer last year that I have used to test and use Nordix - Yggdrasil. The one I am writing here is more of a realese ready installer.

## First impressions
An installer is the first impression you get of a system, but its appearance has nothing to do with whether a system is modern or not, whether a system is technically good or bad, but it is a first impression and using ready-made installers like Calamares gives a professional impression.

## Why not Calamarer?

Calamares is great for handling standard installations, perfect for giving the user smooth system setup with location, language, keyboard, partitioning, formatting your drive and configure a bootloader.
But when a system like Nordix deviates from this standard with zfs and its various vdev layouts it becomes problematic, not using a traditional bootloader but instead using Zfsbootmenu means that you have to put more work into "hacking" Calameres than it takes to write your own installer.
I have had different ideas for how this setup should look, an installer written with python GUI or similar has been one of my thoughts at first, but then I think that for a first release I should not bother too much with it. A graphical installer can also introduce compatibility issues with diverse hardware, using Bash and Gum ensures it runs on any console without extra drivers.

## Nordix installer
The philosophy behind the Nordix installer is that it should be modular and easy to understand. One idea I have is that you should be able to use the Nordix installer easily for your own projects. If you want to share your system, you should be able to easily see in the Nordix installer which parts you need to replace to apply your own system. This also means that it will be easier to contribute to the Nordix installer if you would like to do so.

> You could think of the Nordix installer as a universal Arch ZFS installer.

# Contribute

Things I write tend to be a bit enthusiastic, but I have to let it be, nothing is written in stone and if you are someone who wants to contribute to this project and maybe make it have a less enthusiastic and more professional impression, you are welcome to help me with this, you are welcome to help and contribute even if you don't want to change the impression of course

#### What I'm working on now and how I think about how it should look

```Fish
nordix-installer
├── choose-scripts
│   ├── select-ashift.sh
│   ├── select-extra-vdev.sh
│   ├── select-gpu.sh
│   ├── select-ram-size.sh
│   └── select-zpool-layout.sh
├── gum-lib
│   └── gum.conf
├── info
│   ├── gum-pager
│   └── zfs
├── install
│   ├── install.conf
│   └── install.sh
└── nordix.sh
```
It works like this that each choose script writes a variable in install.conf which is then read by the installation, so there is nothing published here that contains the installation yet, this is only how the logic and function of the installer should work, i.e. the TUI framework so to speak.

At the time of writing, I don't know if it will work like this:
 - A Linear/Wizard-style flow (similar to FreeBSD): A guided, step-by-step sequence. 
 - A Menu-driven/Non-linear flow (similar to archinstall): A central menu where the user can configure settings in any order before starting the installation.
